This script install programs and set their configs to fit my personal preferences. Currently, only the installation and cleanup phases are implemented. It is made for Fedora 33 Workstation but will be updated to work for newer releases as needed. To run the script, allow the script to be executed with the command, "chmod 744 FedoraSetup.sh". Then execute it by typing sudo ./FedoraSetup.sh, and follow the prompts the script provides.
