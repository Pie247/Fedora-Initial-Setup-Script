This script install programs and set their configs to fit my personal preferences. It is made for Fedora 33 Workstation but will be updated to work for newer releases as needed.

TO-DO:
1. Cleanup existing code
2. Call all existing scripts from a Python script
3. Automate setup and installation of programs that require GUI configuration
